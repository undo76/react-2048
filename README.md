# react-2048

Implementation of the game 2048, using Parcel, React and react-spring. 

## History

Originally developed with Riot.js and then ported to Typescript and React in order to experiment with Parcel, react-spring, gestures and react-hooks.

## TO DO

 - Some animations are not implemented yet.
 - The state of the game is ported from the original Riot.js implementation in a mutable fashion, it would be nicer to implement as a state reducer.
 - The game engine wasn't prepared for animations, they are an afterthought that adds complexity to the implementation. It should be reimplemented with animations in mind
 - The end screen is ugly.
